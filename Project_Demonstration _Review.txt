Project Demonstration & Review
The review process consists of these steps:

Submission to LMS
Commit your deploying code to Gitlab — it must compile and any unit tests you created must succeed, and you must be able to start up the pipeline and demonstrate it from the repo.

Presentation
You will need to present your project to others, and discuss your solution and favourite code overview with them.

Aim for a 40 minutes presentation, followed by time for Q&A, that has the following structure:

Present the system functionality by invoking the API directly, as well as using the web app.

A quick overview and discussion of the solution designs you did — include paper drawings, whiteboard photographs or digital designs.

An overview and discussion of the system and deployment architecture — include paper drawings, whiteboard photographs or digital designs.

A discussion of the high-level structure of your code, i.e. overview of the directory structure and classes, and your reason for the structure.

A discussion of the deployment code and build pipelines.

Discussion on the favourite pieces of the codebase — show it on screen, and briefly discuss why you like it.

Thoughts on how you would evolve the system further, if you had the time.
